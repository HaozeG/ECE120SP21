QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab11.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab11.bin.)

ANSWER: 
This program will replace the data stored in R2 with a number which decimal value is 12.
The modified register is R2. It will contain the decimal number 12 when the program finishes. 


QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: 
Because we can see which instruction would be done and what had changed. In this way, we could figure out which step is wrong. If we cannot step through a program, we must check the instructions by our mind, which is far more difficult.
